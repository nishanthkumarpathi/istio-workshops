# Get Started With Istio Service Mesh

This lab explains how to get started with Istio and explore various functions Istio provides to your organization. We cover the following topics in this workshop:

* Install Istio
* Secure services with Istio Ingress Gateway
* Add Services to the Mesh
* Secure interservices communication with Istio
* Control Traffic

## Lab environment and prep

We will use a Kubernetes cluster offered by instruqt to run the lab. You can also use a Kubernetes cluster provided by your cloud provider or follow the instruction below to setup a Kubernetes cluster on your laptop.

### Lab environment prep on your local laptop

Alternatively, you can also run this lab on your laptop where Docker is supported. Due to a known issue with MetalLB with MacOS. If you are running this lab on MacOS, we recommend you to run a [vagrant Ubuntu VM](https://github.com/solo-io/workshops/blob/master/VAGRANT.md) on your MacOS.

### Set up Kubernetes cluster with Kind

From the terminal go to the `/home/solo/workshops/scripts` directory:

```text
cd /home/solo/workshops/scripts
```

Run the following commands to deploy a single Kubernetes cluster using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/):

```bash
./deploy.sh 1 istio-workshop
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note the `1` in the CLI command above
{% endhint %}

Kind should automatically set up the Kubernetes context for the `kubectl` CLI tool, but to make sure you're pointed to the right cluster, run the following:

```bash
kubectl config use-context istio-workshop
```

### Set up Kubernetes cluster with k3d

Run the following commands to download k3d and setup a Kubernetes cluster after you start your Docker deamon:

```text
labs/setup/setup-k3d.sh
```

You should have a working k3s cluster:

```text
kubectl get pods -A                                                     (8d22h44m)î‚² 14:27:26
NAMESPACE     NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   metrics-server-86cbb8457f-d9rch           1/1     Running   0          52s
kube-system   local-path-provisioner-7c458769fb-qczf5   1/1     Running   0          52s
kube-system   coredns-854c77959c-d69qd                  1/1     Running   0          52s
```

## Start the lab!

Now go to the directory that has the workshop material:

```text
cd /home/solo/istio-workshops/istio-basics/
```
